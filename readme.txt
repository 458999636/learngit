Sometimes that thing you are searching for your whole life,It's right there by your side all along
Don't ever let anyone tell you what you can do and what you can't.
There's no escaping reason ,no denying purpose.
I have a dream;
Learn to focus on what you can change and not worry about what you can't change.
